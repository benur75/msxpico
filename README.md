ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeroen Taverne

I have created a multi purpose cartridge for MSX computers. It's based on a Raspberry Pi Pico clone with 16MB of FLASH memory and 256 kBytes of RAM.

The MSX Pico cartridge features:

- A 3D printed cartridge case.
- PCB with gold plated contacts.
- Built in ready to use well known ROMs.
- Built in Nextor to use micro SD card in MSXDOS2. When Nextor is used, 224 kByte extra RAM, SCC+ and Basic Kun plus is available as well
- Stereo high quality audio DAC with 3.5mm output.
- SCC+ emulation (PSG left, SCC+ right).
- Dual PSG emulation (PSG1 left, PSG2 right).
- MP3 playback in stereo (48kHz maximum sampling rate).
- RGB status LED, also used for showing audio level.
- MIDI output through mini USB which uses same cable as the Midi Pac. A cable can be ordered as add-on.
- USB-C connection for firmware updates.
- ROM files with a maximum of 4MB can directly be loaded from micro SD card by the built in menu without using Sofarun or Romload.
- DSK files can directly be used from micro SD card using disk ROM emulation
- Automatic mapper type detection weith manual adjustment. Supported mapper types: ASCII8, ASCII16, Konami with and without SCC.
- 50/60Hz video output selection
